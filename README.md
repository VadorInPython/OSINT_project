# Maritime Vessel Detection using OSINT and Computer Vision

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered system for maritime vessel detection using open-source intelligence (OSINT) principles and computer vision techniques. The system leverages publicly available camera feeds from Danish bridges to detect and analyze ship movements in real-time.

## Objectives
- Conduct comprehensive literature review on ship detection methods in computer vision
- Apply OSINT principles to gather real-world maritime surveillance data
- Develop robust AI models for ship detection in video streams
- Create an automated pipeline for data collection and preprocessing
- Evaluate and optimize model performance for real-world applications

## Methodology

### 1. Literature Review
- Analysis of current computer vision methods for maritime vessel detection
- Study of deep learning architectures suitable for maritime surveillance
- Review of existing datasets and their characteristics
- Investigation of performance metrics and evaluation methods

### 2. OSINT Implementation
- Identification and access of open-source camera feeds from Danish bridges
- Development of data collection protocols
- Implementation of ethical considerations and data privacy measures
- Documentation of data sources and collection methods

### 3. Data Management
- Creation of automated data collection pipeline
- Implementation of preprocessing techniques for video feeds
- Dataset aggregation from multiple open-source repositories
- Development of data cleaning and validation procedures

### 4. AI Model Development
- Design and implementation of deep learning architectures
- Training and validation procedures
- Performance optimization techniques
- Real-time processing capabilities
